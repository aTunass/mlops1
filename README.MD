# VietOCR - Notes for ONNX Export

## ‚ùó Problem When Exporting to ONNX

During model export using `torch.onnx.export`, the following error may occur when loading the model:

```bash
onnxruntime_pybind11_state.Fail: Load model from ... failed:
Node (/cnn/model/Transpose_1) Op (Transpose) [TypeInferenceError]
Invalid attribute perm {-1, 0, 1}
```

### üîç Reason

PyTorch allows the use of **negative indices** in `permute()` or `transpose()` (e.g., `-1` refers to the last dimension).  
However, **ONNX does not support negative indices** for the `Transpose` operator.

For example, this code is valid in PyTorch:

```python
conv = conv.transpose(-1, -2)
conv = conv.flatten(2)
conv = conv.permute(-1, 0, 1)  # ‚ùå This causes ONNX export to fail
```
‚úÖ Solution

After install vietocr:
```bash
pip install vietocr
```
Replace all negative indices in permute() or transpose() with explicit positive indices based on the tensor's shape.

üìÇ **Edit this file:** `<your_env_path>/site-packages/vietocr/model/backbone/vgg.py` or `<your_env_path>/site-packages/vietocr/model/backbone/resnet.py`

```python
conv = conv.transpose(-1, -2)        # still OK in PyTorch and ONNX
conv = conv.flatten(2)
conv = conv.permute(2, 0, 1)         # ‚úÖ ONNX-compatible
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** If you want to run the model again with PyTorch, make sure to revert the changes and restore the original use of negative indices. These are valid in PyTorch and may be required for correct behavior during standard training or inference.
